# across-tabs-vue-chrome-extension-boilerplate

##It works on my machine ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

A small quick and dirty boilerplate for a chrome extension using vue and
 across-tabs. It is also running as normal web app.
 
The current version of the chrome extension demonstrates a bug in across-tabs
 which fires multiple post messages instead of a single one.
